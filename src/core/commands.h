/**
 * Argument codes are used to automatically parse arguments
 * for a a hub command.
 *
 * u = user (must exist in hub session, or will cause error)
 * n = nick name (string)
 * i = CID (must exist in hub)
 * a = (IP) address (must be a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address)
 * r = (IP) address range (either: IP-IP or IP/mask, both IPv4 or IPv6 work)
 * m = message (string)
 * p = password (string)
 * C = credentials (see auth_string_to_cred).
 * c = command (name of command)
 * N = number (integer)
 *
 * Prefix an argument with ? to make it optional.
 * Prefix with + to make the argument greedy, which causes it to grab the rest of the line ignoring boundaries (only supported for string types).
 *
 * NOTE: if an argument is optional then all following arguments must also be optional.
 * NOTE: You can combine optional and greedy, example: "?+m" would match "", "a", "a b c", etc.
 *
 * Example:
 * "nia" means "nick cid ip"
 * "n?p" means "nick [password]" where password is optional.
 * "?N?N" means zero, one, or two integers.
 * "?NN" means zero or two integers.
 * "?+m" means an optional string which may contain spaces that would otherwise be split into separate arguments.
