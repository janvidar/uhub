= Architecture of uHub =

uHub is single-threaded and handles network and timer events using the
libevent library.
For each state there is a read event (and sometimes a write event) and timeout
event in case an expected read (or write) event does not occur.


== Protocol overview ==
uHub "speaks" the ADC protocol, which works in short as follows:
(C = client, S = server aka uHub).

C: HSUP ADBASE
Client connects to hub and supplies a list of supported features to the hub.

S: ISUP ADBASE { }
Server responds with a list of supported features.

S: ISID xxxx
Server assigns a session-ID to the client (4 bytes, BASE32 encoded).

C: BINF xxxx (...)
Client sends information about itself, such as nick name, etc.
The hub will relay this information to all users, including the client.

S: BINF xxx1 NInick1 (...)
S: BINF xxx2 NInick2
S: (...)
S: BINF xxxx (client's own nick)
Client gets list of other clients, which ends with the client's own user info.
At this point the client is successfully logged into the hub.
