# You should normally place this file in /etc/uhub/uhub.conf

# This file is read only to the uhub deamon, and if you
# make changes to it while uhub is running you can send a
# HUP signal to it ( $ killall -HUP uhub ), to reparse configuration (only on UNIX).
# All configuration directives: http://www.uhub.org/config.php

# server_bind_addr=any means listen to "::" if IPv6 is supported
# by the host OS, otherwise 0.0.0.0.
